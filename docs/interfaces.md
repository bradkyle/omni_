Interfaces represent the functionality it takes to turn a multidimensional
action representation. i.e. [0.213, 0.343, -0.3243, 0.999, 0.666] into the
representative functionality from which observations and rewards can be
perceived.
The above functionality might be generated dynamically by AI.
i.e. The channels might be encoded into vector representations and then
be dynamically generated by a generative adversarial setup whereby the
generative model will be given a set of data and will have to generate
premade pathways or requests that can be parametrised.
In analysis of this rewards should also be dynamically generated as such.
